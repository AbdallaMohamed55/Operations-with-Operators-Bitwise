# Operations-with-Operators-Bitwise

To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators

Aim: The objective is to study and implement bitwise operators in C++ that operate on individual bits of integer data types to perform low-level data manipulation efficiently.

Procedure:

Write a program to accept two integer inputs from the user.

Demonstrate the use of bitwise AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>) operators.

Apply each bitwise operator on the input values.

Display the decimal results of each operation on the console.

Observe and analyze how bits of the numbers are affected by each operator.

Compile and run the program to check for correctness.

Conclusion: This experiment enhanced the understanding of bitwise operators and their applications in manipulating individual bits. It showed the significance of these operators in tasks like masking, toggling bits, and performing efficient computations at a low level.
